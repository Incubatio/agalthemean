[UPDATE 2016]
This project was an experiment from 2011 and has since been dead, but it is a useful utility. The commit a7b0662cd0958f7eedf0b76c47319398585bb316 revives it
by hardcoding the dependencies that were used at the moment, hence making this work 'out of the box'. The old flex SDK 4 needs to be used
for compilation however.
Notice that you can also just use the build html to avoid compiling.

An experimental real time AGAL editor based on Minimole. Experimental as in not intended to be a finished product, but rather a tool for myself for experimenting and learning AGAL.
